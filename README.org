Computers & Structures publishes advances in the development and use of computational methods for the solution of problems in engineering and the sciences. The range of appropriate contributions is wide, and includes papers on establishing appropriate mathematical models and their numerical solution in all areas of mechanics. The journal also includes articles that present a substantial review of a field in the topics of the journal. With the modern use of computers and numerical methods to model and solve problems, the traditional boundaries between the fields of solid/structural mechanics and fluid mechanics hardly exist any longer, and multiphysics problems are solved that involve all aspects of mechanics. The word 'structures' must therefore now be interpreted in a broad sense including solids, fluids and multiphysics.

Mechanics Research Communications publishes, as rapidly as possible, peer-reviewed manuscripts of high standards but restricted length. It aims to provide:
+ a fast means of communication
+ an exchange of ideas among workers in mechanics
+ an effective method of bringing new results quickly to the public
+ an informal vehicle for the discussion of ideas that may still be in the formative stages

The field of Mechanics will be understood to encompass the behavior of continua, fluids, solids, particles and their mixtures. Submissions must contain a strong, novel contribution to the field of mechanics, and ideally should be focused on current issues in the field involving theoretical, experimental and/or applied research, preferably within the broad expertise encompassed by the Board of Associate Editors. Deviations from these areas should be discussed in advance with the Editor-in-Chief.
